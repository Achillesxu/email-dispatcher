### 💻 About the project

<p align="center">

The project is an email dispatcher that is one of the pieces of the authentication microservice that can be seen [here](https://github.com/aawadallak/Account-management-service),
the main idea was to connect the micro services using a messaging technology with Apache Kafka, currently the service is consuming a topic and based on information
from the header, it sends a template email template to the user, which can be a welcome code confirmation, email change, or password change.
